The study of the project is about the use of machine learning in
predicting diabetes. Three well-known machine learning algorithms, Extreme
Gradient Boost , Support Vector Machine and Naïve Bayes. The algorithms were
compared using their respective confusion matrix, where values such as
accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score. The study found that Extreme
Gradient Boost is the best option when detecting diabetes using the dataset
used in this study. Extreme Gradient Boost classifies 96% while Support Vector
Machine is 81% and Naïve Bayes is 76%
